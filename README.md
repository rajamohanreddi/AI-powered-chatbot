# AI-powered-chatbot
Project Report: AI-Powered Chatbot
#Overview
The goal of this project is to design and deploy a smart chatbot that can handle customer support queries or frequently asked questions. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), the chatbot offers dynamic, contextual responses and maintains interaction logs for analysis and feedback.

#Technologies Used

Technology	Purpose
Python	Core language for development and NLP processing
NLTK	Preprocessing texts: tokenization, stemming, stop word removal
Transformers	Using pretrained models (like BERT or GPT) for contextual response
Flask/FastAPI	Serving the chatbot via an HTTP API or web application
SQLite	Lightweight database to store user conversations and logs

#Features Implemented
Contextual NLP Engine using transformer models for natural and coherent replies.

FAQ Matching System that uses semantic similarity to resolve common user questions.

Web API Integration with Flask or FastAPI for real-time interactions.

Session Management & Logging through SQLite for storing query history, timestamps, and feedback.

Fallback Responses to gracefully handle out-of-scope questions or failures.

# Outcomes Achieved
Deployed a fully functional chatbot with dynamic, context-aware conversation flow.

Logged interactions with metadata for future refinement and user behavior analysis.

Demonstrated ease of scaling by integrating external models or migrating the backend to cloud infrastructure (e.g., PostgreSQL or AWS RDS).

# Learning Highlights
Practical implementation of NLP pipelines from preprocessing to semantic modeling.

Comparison of transformer models based on accuracy and latency (e.g., BERT vs DistilBERT).

Frontend integration possibilities for seamless UI/UX in customer-facing applications.
